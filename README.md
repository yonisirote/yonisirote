## About me

I’m a Computer Science graduate from **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem** who enjoys building real systems and understanding how things work under the hood. I’m especially interested in backend and systems-level development, and I like projects that touch networking, infrastructure, and performance.

- Building personal projects with production-like architecture
- Background in data structures, algorithms, operating systems, and networking
- Actively seeking a **junior software developer** role

- Encrypts, sends, receives, and decrypts traffic over UDP

**Server**
- Configures TUN, IP forwarding, and NAT
- Handles encrypted UDP traffic and forwards packets
- Deployed on AWS EC2

**Tech**
Python, TUN/TAP, UDP sockets, NAT, AES-256-GCM, AWS EC2
